A Visual Studio Code extension to interact with LEGO® Hubs running the Pybricks firmware, inspired by [dusongpei](https://github.com/dsp05/pybricks-vscode)'s work.

## Features

Streamline your Pybricks coding experience with:

- **Connect/disconnect your Hub** via Bluetooth
- **Start/stop programs** directly from VS Code
- **Compile and upload Python scripts** from your workspace
- **View compilation and runtime errors** in your code
- **Auto-connect** to the last used hub
- **Auto-start** your script on save
- **Open and convert** majority of the LEGO robotics file formats
- **Receive program status** and **display hub output messages**

## Getting Started

1. **Install** this extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](#).
2. **Connect** your LEGO Hub via Bluetooth.
3. **Open** your Python or LEGO robotics files.
4. **Use** the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) to access Pybricks commands.

## Supported LEGO File Formats

This extension opens, displays, analyzes, and converts most major LEGO robotics file formats for easy onboarding, backup, and analysis.

### Features for LEGO Files

- Pseudocode representation of block programs
- Graphical preview of block-based code
- Module dependency visualization of code structure
- Convert block code to compatible Pybricks Python code<sup>*</sup>

<sup>*Experimental: Please verify converted code and provide feedback.</sup>
